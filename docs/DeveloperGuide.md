## Implementation

### Add feature

The add feature is implemented using a `AddCommand` class extending from `Command` Class. 
`AddCommand` contains an `execute` methods, which utilises the internal `spiltDetails` methods to extract the food details
and to construct new `food` object .
It is also facilitated by `Foodlist` Class, using `addFood` method of `FoodList` Class.

The add feature implementation is as follows:
1. New AddCommand object is created by passing in a String containing food details
2. `splitDetails` is called to split the string
3. boolean `hasQuantity` is used to record whether the string contains `-q` quantity flag
4. Split the string using ` -q ` regardless of whether the string contains the quantity part
5. Check the index of `-n` and `-e` and split the string to save the details of the food name and expiry date
6. If `hasQuantity` is `true`, return a String array with `name`, `date` and `quantity`, else only return
a String array with `name` and `date`.
7. Create a new `Food` object and use `addFood` to add the new food into the food list
8. Return a `CommandResult` to show the successful message to the user

### Remove feature
The remove command is implemented using a `RemoveCommand` class which
utilizes `removeFood` method of the FoodList.

The `removeFood` method implementation is as follows:
1. New `RemoveCommand` object is created by passing in a String containing arguments from `Parser`.
2. The `index` of the item to be deleted will be taken as its arguments.
3. The method `execute` of `Command` class will be called from `Duke` with the `index`.
4. This method will determine if there exist a food item with that `index` in the `FoodList`.
5. If it exists, the food item will be deleted and feedback to the user that it has been successfully removed.
6. Otherwise, the feedback will be an error message
7. This method will return an object called `CommandResult` and pass `feedbackToUser` as its argument.
8. `Duke` will subsequently call `printResult` method from `CommandResult`.

### Find feature
The find command is implemented using a `FindCommand` class which
utilizes `findFood` method of the FoodList.

The `findFood` method implementation is as follows:
1. Initialize `FoodList` result variable
2. Start a loop iterating over each foodItem 
3. Do word processing on a term and check if the foodItem name includes it
4. Enter a loop with switch statement for each component of the `flags` argument 
5. If some flag is not satisfied, continue the loop without adding foodItem to the result
6. If the flags loop is over, the flags conditions were satisfied, so add the foodItem to the result

### List feature
The list command is implemented using a `ListCommand` class which utilizes `COMMAND_WORD`
attributes of all other commands within the `commands` package.

The list command is implemented as follows:
1. New `ListCommand` object created will call the method `execute` of `Command` class.
2. The method `execute` decides what to append to the string `printToUser` according to `foodList`. 
3. `foodList` is an object of type `FoodList` that is passed as argument to `execute`, it consists of the list of food 
that has been added by user.
4. `foodList` contains of `Food` that has undergoes the `toString` method.
5. `execute` will check if `numberOfFood` is greater than 0, in which `numberOfFood` is obtained from the `FoodList` 
function `getNumberOfFood`.
6. If `numberOfFood` is greater than 0,  the foodList in String will be appended to `printToUser`. If it is not, then 
the empty `foodList` will not be appended to `printToUser`.
7. After appending the `foodList`, the method `execute` will return an object called `CommandResult` and pass          
`printToUser` as its argument.
8. `Duke` will then call `printResult` method from `CommandResult` which will print the food list for the user.

### Help feature
The help command is implemented using a `HelpCommand` class which utilizes `COMMAND_WORD` 
attributes of all other commands within the `commands` package. 

The help command is implemented as follows:
1. New `HelpCommand` object is created by passing in a String containing arguments from `Parser`.
2. The constructor `HelpCommand` will split the arguments based on the `--` regex and store them in an array of
strings called `filters`.
3. The method `execute` of `Command` class will then be called all the way from `Duke` with `filters` as its argument. 
4. This method decides what to append to the string `printToUser` as specified by the `filters`. 
5. After looping through all the `filters`, this method will return an object called `CommandResult` and pass
`printToUser` as its argument.
6. `Duke` will then call `printResult` method from `CommandResult` which will print the necessary message.

## Appendix: Requirements
# Product scope
**Project Direction**
- Food Supplies Tracker: Main function is to track expiry dates 
and storage area of foods as to minimise food shortage.

- **Target user profile:**
- Kitchen worker, Homemaker
- has a need to manage food
- prefer desktop apps over other types
- can type fast
- prefers typing to mouse interactions
- is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition:**
1) Manage food supply faster than a typical mouse / GUI driven app
2) Check the expiry date of a particular food quickly
3) Check the foods in the most recent expiry dates quickly
4) Get suggestions and alert to consume foods that are going to expire soon

Currently, the following functionality was implemented:

`add -n PRODUCT_NAME -e EXPIRY_DATE {-p QUANTITY}`

`add -e EXPIRY_DATE -n PRODUCT_NAME {-p QUANTITY}`

`find {PRODUCT_NAME}`

`find {PRODUCT_NAME} -fresh`

`find {PRODUCT_NAME} -expired`

`help {--COMMAND_WORD}`

The next possible flag to implement will be `-c` which stands for `categories`
