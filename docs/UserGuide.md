# User Guide

## Introduction

Food Supply Tracker (FSP) is a desktop app for managing food supplies, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, FSP can get your food management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

## Features

##### Quick notes about the command format:
1. Words in UPPER_CASE are the parameters to be supplied by the user.
2. Parameters in the `{ }` are optionals, and `{ }` the bracket characters cannot be included in the command line.
3. Optional flags are put in curly braces.
4. Parameter is expected only once in the command. If you specify it multiple times, it will be deemed as invalid command.

### Viewing help

`help`- Show a message explaining how to access the help page and the command specified.
* Any extraneous parameters input after the command `help` will be ignored.

  (e.g. `help 123 abcde` will still work as `help`)

- When a filter (prefix <code>--</code>) is applied, the help message will display the helper for the specified command.
- By default, all available commands and the link to the user guide would be displayed.

Format: `help {--COMMAND_WORD}`

Example of usage:

Input:

<code>help --remove --find</code>

Output:
```
______________________________
Command 'remove': This command removes the food product from the food supply tracker based on its index.
Format: remove INDEX


Command 'find': This command filters the list according to the flags applied.
Format: find {PRODUCT_NAME} {--fresh} {--expired} {--flag ATTRIBUTE_NAME}
List of valid flags as follows:
   --fresh: list non-expired items
   --expired: list expired items
   --u: filter by unit
   --q: filter by quantity
   --c: filter by category
It is possible to have multiple flags (all flags will be accounted for. i.e. with more flags, the list can only get smaller or remain the same).

______________________________
```

### Adding a food product 

`add` - Add a food product to the list of food items.

Format: `add --n FOOD_NAME --e DD/MM/YYYY {--c CAT --q QUANTITY --u UNITS}`

* The parameter cannot contain any punctuations, or else it will return as incorrect command.
* The order of format should be strictly followed.
* `--n FOOD_NAME` and `--e DD/MM/YYYY` are compulsory.
* `--c CAT`and`--q QUANTITY -u UNITS` are optional.
  * `--u UNIT` must be added together with `--q QUANTITY`.
  * `--q QUANTITY` can be added without `--u UNIT`
    * For example, a proper command can be `add --n milk --e 21/03/2025 --q 10.0`. 
However, it cannot be `add --n milk --e 21/03/2025 --u packets`
* For `CATEGORY`, we have `FRUIT, VEGETABLE, MEAT, DAIRY, GRAIN, SEAFOOD, BEVERAGE, OTHERS`
any other category or no category added will be deemed as `OTHERS`.
* For `UNIT`, we have `mg`, `g`, `kg`, `ml`, `l`, `unit`, `units`, `serving`, `servings`, `packet`, `packets`, 
`box` and `boxes`. 
  * Default `UNIT` will be deemed as `unit` or `units` according to the value of `QUANTITY`.
  * If `QUANTITY` added is more than 1, then the `UNIT` will automatically change to plural form such as `units`, 
  `servings`, `packets` and `boxes` if applicable.
  * If `QUANTITY` added is 1, then the `UNIT` will automatically change to singular form such as `unit`, `serving`,
  `packet` and `box` if applicable.

Examples of usage:

Input 1: `add --n milk --e 21/03/2025 --c dairy --q 10 --u packets`

Output 1: 

(The product is added on 06/04/2023, thus it shows 715 days left. The display of remaining freshness date will vary,
based on your current date)
```
______________________________

Input 3: `add --n bread --e 11/11/2023 --q 2 --u box`

Output 3:

* `QUANTITY` of `bread` is more than 1
* Unit of `bread` is `boxes` instead of `box` which is the value of `UNIT`.

```

```

### Listing all food products

`list` - List all food products available in the tracker.
* Maximum number of food products in the list is 9999.
* Any extraneous parameters input after the command `list` will be ignored.

  (e.g. `list 123 abcde` will still work as `list`)

- The list is sorted in order of the expiry dates, regardless of the order of food that is added.
- All food products will be listed with its index, name, freshness, expiry date, number of days left / expired,
category and quantity together with its units.
- Food products without any quantity added or with its quantity as `0.0` will be listed with its index, name, freshness, 
expiry date, number of days left / expired and category.

  - Number of days left will decrease as the day passed by.
  - Number of days expired will increase as the day passed by.
  - Freshness of food will be `(fresh)` if its expiry date is after today (number of days left > 0).
  - Freshness of food will be `(expired)` if its expiry date is today and before today (number of days left <= 0).

Format: `list`

Example of usage:

(Number of days depends on today's date: 07/04/2023)

Input: `list`

### Finding food products by name and attributes
`find` - List all food products with matching name and filters

**Format:** `find {TERM} {--fresh} {--expired} {--flag ATTRIBUTE_NAME}`

Allowed flags to find the food item:
* fresh items: `--fresh`
* expired items: `--expired`
* unit: `--u {UNIT}`
* quantity: `--q {number}`
* category: `--c {CATEGORY}`

**Notes:**
- The term is optional, and it's possible to only use filters for finding products
  - E.g., `find --fresh` will give all the fresh items
- The search is case-insensitive.
  - E.g. "eggs" will match "Eggs"
- Parts of words will be matched.
  - E.g. "egg" will match "eggs"
- Using empty query will output user error.
  - E.g. typing `find` will result in "No term or flag provided"
- Using both `--fresh` and `--expired` will give no results.
  - E.g. typing `find --fresh --expired` will result in "No food found for such query"

**Example of Usage:**

(Number of days depends on today's date)

### Clearing the food list
`clear` - This command will clear the entire food list.

  (e.g. `clear 123 abcde` will still work as `clear`)

Output:

```
______________________________
Clearing the food list as requested...
______________________________
```

### Exiting FSP
`exit` - This command will save the food list in an external file before closing the program.
* Any extraneous parameters input after the command `exit` will be ignored.

  (e.g. `exit 123 abcde` will still work as `exit`)

### Editing foodTrackerList text file
It is possible for users to edit their food list without using the program. However, the editing should take when the
program is not running as the edits will not be saved otherwise (the program has higher priority).

#### The syntax and logic of the file is as follows
* Syntax:
  * `|n` indicates the name of the food 
  * `|e` indicates the expiry date
  * `|q` indicates the quantity 
  * `|u` indicates the unit
  * `|c` indicates the category
* When more than one of the same identifier is used, the value associated with the last identifier will be used.
* It is possible for optional attributes which includes `quantity`, `unit` and `category` to be not included.
* Compulsory attributes such as `name` and `expiry date` have to be included or else the line of data will be ignored.

## FAQ

**Q1**: Do I need other software to support FSP?

**A**: No, you do not need any other software to support FSP.

**Q2**: I am unable to add the food product./I cannot list the food items./ I cannot remove the items.

**A**: Please take note of the command line format shown in the features section. Type ‘help’ to show the command line and please follow the command line exactly. Moreover, please check that the parameters are also in the correct format to avoid meaningless addition of food product.

**Q3**: Is searching case-sensitive?

**A**: No, and items matching at least one keyword will be returned.

**Q4**: Can I write creative names for my food items?

**A**: Yes, you may do that to increase the amusement when listing the food items. However, it might be difficult for you to search for that specific item.

**Q5**: What if I add the item's name incorrectly?

**A**: Currently, we have not implemented the edit features. Please remove the item that you created wrongly and add a new food product.

**Q6**: Can I export my food list into CSV files?

**A**: Sorry, currently FSP does not have such features, but we will work on it in the future.

**Q7**:How do I transfer my data to another Computer?

**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous FSP home folder.
