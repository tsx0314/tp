## Project: Food Supply Tracker

Food Supply Tracker(FSP) is a desktop food list tracking the expiry date of the food in the list.
It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) . 
If you can type fast, FSP can get your food management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

+ New Feature: Add Feature (add food items in the food list)
  + What it does: It allows the user to add food item with details. For example, the user can add expiry date and so on. 
  + Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because usually a user may forget what it is put into the list
  , and it is inconvenient for user to 'list' all items at once, and check through all the products. 
  With the parameter of 'expiry date', it allows users to immediately know which products will be soon and consume it 
  as soon as possible. 
  + Enhancements implemented: 
    + Allow users to add additional details, including `category`, `quantity` and `unit`.
    + Add Javadoc comments for classes and methods
    + Add JUnit tests for ListCommand and AddAlertCommand
