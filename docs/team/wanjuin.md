## Project: Food Supply Tracker

### Overview
Food Supply Tracker (FSP) is a desktop food list tracking the expiry date of the food in the list.
It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI). If you can type fast, FSP can get your food management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

### Contributions

**1) New Feature: List Command**
  * What it does: List out all the food products in the order of expiry dates.
  * Justification: This feature makes viewing the food products a user convenient. Listing food in order 
of expiry dates makes it neater for user to look at foods that are expiring soon.
  * Enhancement implemented: 
    * Indicator of the number of days left or number of days expired to expired beside expiry date.
    * Label beside each food to indicate whether the food is expired or not.
    * Remind users the number of food products they still have in the list.

**2) New Feature: Add `-u` unit feature in the Add Food feature**
  * What it does: Allows the addition of unit to the food products. 
  * Justification: User can choose unit to gauge the remaining quantity 
of the food product that they are left. For example if the remaining quantity
is 2 without unit, it would be confusing how much is a "2". It could be 2 packets
or 2 boxes.
  * Enhancement implemented: 
     * Fixed set of units that users can choose from (Enumerations).
     * Food with common unit such as `milligrams` or `litre`, would automatically be
     assigned to units `mg` and `l` respectively, according to the fixed list of units provided.
     * Unit would change to plural or singular form according to the food quantity.

**3) New feature: Clear Command**
   * What it does: Allows users to clear the entire food list using one command.
   * Justification: Delete the entire food list, without the need of deleting food products one by one.
